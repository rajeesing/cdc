# About Change Data Capture (CDC)
Change data capture utilizes the SQL Server Agent to log insertions, updates, and deletions occurring in a table. So, it makes these data changes accessible to be easily consumed using a relational format.

# Configure for CDC
We are using SQL Server as a database for all our CDC activity with sysadmin permission. 

## Pre-requisit
Change data capture is only available in the Enterprise, Developer, Enterprise Evaluation, and Standard editions.

Create or Find the database in which you want to enable CDC and execute below script (easier when you use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. If you don't have one, install it from here https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup). Just make sure SQL Server Agent is enabled which you can do from Windows Services (type services.msc in run window [âŠž + R])

```
USE cdcexample
GO
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db
GO
```
Note: Here cdcexample is the name of the database. Please replace it with your database name.

If you wish to disable the CDC, you can use the below script:

```
USE cdcexample
GO
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_db
GO
```
Now your database has enabled CDC, this is the time to identify which table that you want to capture activities (insert, update, delete DML operations) and use the below script to enable CDC on the table:

```
USE cdcexample
GO

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
    @source_schema = N'dbo',
    @source_name   = N'Employee', --table name
    @role_name     = N'MyRole', --A role for controlling access to a change table, if you don't want to grant any role, simply assign NULL
    @supports_net_changes = 1 -- if it is set to 1, a net changes function is also generated for the capture instance. This function returns only one change for each distinct row changed in the interval specified in the call.
GO
```
If you wanted to disable the CDC on the table, use the below script:
```
USE cdcexample
GO
    EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_table
    @source_schema = N'dbo',
    @source_name   = N'Employee',
    @capture_instance = N'dbo_Employee' -- this you can find in the change_tables entity by expanding your database explorer and System Tables folder in the tree view.
GO
```
# Change Data Capture Setup
After enabling CDC on both you should see a minimum set of tables created under System Tables with cdc schema:
1. cdc.captured_columns
2. cdc.change_tables
3. cdc.dbo_Employee_CT
4. cdc.ddl_history
5. cdc.index_columns
6. cdc.lsn_time_mapping
7. dbo.systransschemas

Try to insert a row in the employee table which has the following schema definitions
```
Table: Employee
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	[MiddleName] [nvarchar](50) NULL,
	[LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	[DesignationId] [int] NOT NULL,
```
Now insert a row to Employee table
```
INSERT INTO dbo.Employee VALUES('John','N.','Doe',1);
INSERT INTO dbo.Employee VALUES('Sally','J.','Smith',1);
```
Output:
| __$start_lsn           | __$end_lsn | __$seqval              | __$operation | __$update_mask | Id | FirstName | MiddleName | LastName | DesignationId | __$command_id |
|------------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------|----|-----------|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 0x0000002A000008990004 | NULL       | 0x0000002A000008990003 | 2            | 0x1F           | 2  | Sally     | J.         | Smith    | 1             | 1             |
| 0x0000002A000008B90003 | NULL       | 0x0000002A000008B90002 | 3            | 0x0A           | 1  | John      | N.         | Doe      | 1             | 1             |

Now let's update one:
```
  Update [dbo].[Employee] SET
  FirstName = 'Johnn',
  LastName = 'Doee'
  WHERE ID = 1
```

Output:
| __$start_lsn           | __$end_lsn | __$seqval              | __$operation | __$update_mask | Id | FirstName | MiddleName | LastName | DesignationId | __$command_id |
|------------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------|----|-----------|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| 0x0000002A000008990004 | NULL       | 0x0000002A000008990003 | 2            | 0x1F           | 2  | Sally     | J.         | Smith    | 1             | 1             |
| 0x0000002A000008B90003 | NULL       | 0x0000002A000008B90002 | 3            | 0x0A           | 1  | John      | N.         | Doe      | 1             | 1             |
| 0x0000002A000008B90003 | NULL       | 0x0000002A000008B90002 | 4            | 0x0A           | 1  | Johnn     | N.         | Doee     | 1             | 1             |

# Data Utilization
## Problem
Let's look what we have been doing. Whenever we need to gather change information, we are transfer batch of data from source to destination at regular intervals or taking a backups of tables where data are residing and restore to the location where we want. The value we are missing here is real time analytics and this might be the issue in terms for resource utilization and data inconsistencies in some cases.
